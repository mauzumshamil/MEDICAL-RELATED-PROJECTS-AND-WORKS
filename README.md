# MEDICAL-RELATED-PROJECTS-AND-WORKS
Medical projects in data science often leverage machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze healthcare data. 
These projects can involve tasks like disease diagnosis from medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRI scans), predicting patient outcomes or treatment responses based on clinical data, identifying patterns in electronic health records to improve patient care, and optimizing hospital operations through predictive analytics. By harnessing the power of ML and DL, these projects aim to enhance medical decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and streamline healthcare processes.
